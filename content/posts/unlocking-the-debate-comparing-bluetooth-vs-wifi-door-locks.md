## Comparing Bluetooth and WiFi Door Locks for Buildings

Having control over access to a building or rental property is vital, yet selecting the best door lock system can be daunting. Two popular options are Bluetooth and WiFi, so let’s look at their pros and cons to help landlords and property managers make the best decision!

Bluetooth and WiFi locks both involve digital access coupled with physical components, such as a card or keypad. Bluetooth locks rely on a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a smartphone, to open the door, while WiFi locks require an enabled network for access. Both offer secure access to a building and knowledgeable users, as well as the ability to monitor who is entering with either option. 

Bluetooth locks are a good choice for those who want an easy to use and convenient entry system. Smartphones can be used to click a button to open the door, and can offer extra security such as facial recognition or passcodes. One downside is that the lock needs to be within range of the device for the access to work, so the property manager or landlord should consider this when installing Bluetooth locks. 

WiFi locks may be a better choice for larger buildings as they can handle more users, and access grants can be controlled by an administrator. They can interact with digital devices and are easy to update and manage. One downside is that they require an internet connection and an enabled network, which could be expensive if these need to be installed. 

In conclusion, both Bluetooth and WiFi door locks can offer landlords and property managers an effective way to control access to their buildings. While Bluetooth locks are convenient, WiFi locks can be more cost effective and offer developers greater control.
