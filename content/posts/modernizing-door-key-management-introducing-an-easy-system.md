Property managers and landlords are frequently faced with the difficult task of regulating access to buildings. Key management can often be a stressful and time-consuming process, with many potential problems arising along the way. To help property managers and landlords better control access to buildings in an easy and efficient way, this article navigates a modern approach to key management via the use of RFID and Bluetooth access control systems. 

By choosing RFID or Bluetooth access control systems, property managers and landlords have the ability to manage access from anywhere. With these systems, users can be granted access with the simple scan of a phone, RFID or badge, streamlining the process of key management. Door readers are designed to securely read access cards or key fobs to allow users entry. Customizable access control settings allow property managers and landlords to be in full control of who has access to each area of their building. 

Along with providing convenience and reducing stress, these access control systems are an affordable and secure solution with customizable reports that provide full audit trails of all entry and exit events. Property managers and landlords can also keep track of all the building's authorized keys and quickly deactivate any lost or stolen cards. Ultimately, modern access control systems provide managers and landlords with an efficient and secure means of key management. 

RFID and Bluetooth access control systems provide a modern and convenient solution for managing access to buildings.
