## Decoding the Different Types of Door Accessory Names
Welcome to a quick guide to understanding some of the common names for door accessories, a helpful tool for property managers and landlords looking for solutions to control access to their buildings.

Door accessories come in all shapes and sizes, as do the names for them. Keeping up with all the different pieces of terminology can sometimes be frustrating. To simplify matters, in this post, let’s look at some of the most common door accessory names and their function. 

A ‘lock’ or ‘locking device’ is one of the most basic door accessories, allowing a property owner to establish and maintain privacy, security and control access through a door. A ‘latch’ or ‘latching device’ is similar, but (unlike a lock) can also hold the door open, or simply secure it in a partially-closed position. 

Other common door accessory names include a ‘hinge’, ‘lever’, ‘knob’, ‘handle’, ‘strike plate’, and ‘closer’. Hinges are used to connect the door to the doorframe and allow it to move freely. Levers and knobs are opening mechanisms that are commonly attached to the door. A handle is another type of opening device but is much more commonly used for sliding doors. A strike plate is used to ensure the door’s lock is secure, and is usually installed in the door frame. A closer is used on a variety of doors from fire doors to closable partitions, and helps to hold open the door. 

By understanding the different types of door accessories, property managers and landlords can make well-informed decisions when it comes to buying and maintaining security systems in their buildings. Whether you are purchasing online or in a store, understanding the function and names of the different accessory pieces makes it easier to find the right product for your access control needs. 

Overall, unlocking the mystery of door accessory names doesn’t have to be a difficult task. With a bit of information, any property manager or landlord can easily select the components they need for their door access solutions.
