## Secure Your Office with a Door Entry System

If you're a property manager or landlord looking for ways to control access to your building or office, a door entry system is a smart, practical solution. With the proper RFID and Bluetooth Door Reader, you can give access to those who need it, block access for those who don't, and maintain a secure and efficient office environment. 

A good door entry system is an integral part of any security setup. Not only will it helps you protect office space, but also the resources, data, and personnel within—all of which are important to maintain a profitable and productive business space. Compared to traditional locks and keys, door entry systems are more secure; they allow you to designate owners, assign access privilege levels, create an audit trail of entries and exits, and more. 

When selecting a door entry system, it's important to choose one that meets your needs and budget. Your choice should depend on the size of your space and the types of users that need access; options like a digital keypad, combination lock, or a fingerprint reader are great for smaller offices or singular access points. For larger offices or multiple access points, consider an RFID or Bluetooth reader—which uses cards or phones for authorization—for more secure and efficient access control. 

At RFIDCanada we offer a range of [RFID and Bluetooth Door Readers for Access Control](/door-readers) to help you step up your office security. Our readers are easy to install, come with a variety of features and are supported by a reliable customer service team. 

Protecting your office is important for any business and the use of a door entry system is a great way to maintain control over who is accessing your property and resources. Invest in an RFID or Bluetooth based door reader to help you keep your space secure.
