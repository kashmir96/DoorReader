## It's Easier to Manage Access with RFID & Bluetooth Door Readers 

Managing access to a business or building can be time consuming and complex depending on the solution chosen. Luckily, the technology available today makes the job much easier with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and Bluetooth Door Readers. Property managers and landlords can control secure access with the use of these tools, without the hassle of manual processes and traditional lock and key systems. 

RFID and Bluetooth Door Readers provide property managers and landlords with powerful access control with real-time intelligence about who has entered and exited the building, when it happened and what areas they accessed. 

An RFID door reader is typically used in key-less entry systems. RFID tags can be linked to a user’s credentials to provide access to certain areas of the building. Thanks to their small size and portability, they do not require a lot of maintenance or heavy installation costs.

BLuetooth Door readers are often used as a hands free access option that require only a user's smartphone to gain access to a certain area. These access control systems can be especially beneficial to residential tenants, as they don’t require the installation of any complex infrastructure to open the door. 

Property managers and landlords can rest assured that access is secure with RFID & Bluetooth Door Readers. Both technologies rely on encrypted chip technology, helping to eliminate the potential for tampering with access cards. As a result, property managers and landlords can save time and money on maintaining their access control systems, as well as greatly reduce the potential for unpredictable security breaches. 

Having the right access control system in place is critical for keeping any building secure. RFID and Bluetooth Door Readers provide property managers and landlords with essential tools for controlling access and ensuring maximum security without the hassle of manual processes.
