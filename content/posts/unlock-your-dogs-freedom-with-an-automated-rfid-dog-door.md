## Unlocking the Freedom of Automated RFID Dog Doors

Have you ever wished that you could give your dog the freedom of wandering in and out of your property with ease? With an automated RFID dog door, you can control your dog’s access both in and out of the building, granting them the freedom to wander, while also helping to protect your property from uninvited guests. 

RFID (radio-frequency identification) pet doors function by reading a chip placed on a pet’s collar, granting it access to the building. The RFID tag, which is recorded in the system, is assigned to each individual pet, ensuring that authorized animals, and only authorized animals, are able to pass through. As this technology doesn’t require the operator to be present at the entrance of a space, you’re able to quickly and conveniently check out who’s accessing your property and limit your building’s access accordingly. 

This technology is especially useful to property managers and landlords, as it allows them to ensure that only the individuals they choose are entering and exiting the building, helping to protect the safety and security of their property.

RFID allows for multiple layers of security, from individualized access codes to configurable settings allowing for single or dual authentication access. Using RFID, users can also set and change privileges for residents, allowing for certain access levels at certain doorways, and granting administrators the peace of mind of knowing that the property is safe and secure. 

An automated RFID pet door can offer the security and control of a traditional door, with the added convenience of allowing pets quick, easy entry and exit access. Whether you’re looking for a simple security solution for your business, or a less invasive one that allows strangers to enter without having to open the door, automated RFID pet doors can provide a balance of both.
