## Advantages of Utilizing a Door Access Card Reader for Property Managers
Property managers, landlords and building owners are faced with the challenge of providing a secure and convenient solution for controlling access to their buildings and premise. A door access card reader is one such solution that offers numerous benefits for owners and their occupants. In this blog we will look at five of the primary benefits of access card readers.

### Enhanced Security
A card access reader provides an extra layer of security to the building. Accessible only by those registered with a valid access card, the reader ensures that the premises is consistently a secure environment and can not be accessed by unauthorised personnel or visitors. 

### Convenient Access Control
The card access reader also provides a high level of convenience for the occupants of the building. With a quick tap of an access card, they can gain entrance to the premises quickly and easily. Furthermore, the access cards are designed to expire so if the card is lost, stolen or falls into the wrong hands, it cannot be used to gain entry at a later date. 

### Flexible Schedules
One of the most convenient aspects of access card readers is their ability to control the access times for individual cards. This feature is especially helpful for property managers that need to set up limited access to certain parts of the building such as the swimming pool or gym. Times can be set for any length of access and for any period of time desired. 

### Manage Utilisation
A door access card reader provides an effective way to manager the utilization of the premises. Property managers can gain access to accurate data including who was in the building and when, allowing them to better understand the utilization trends and make changes as needed. 

### Reduction in Cost
 While the initial investment might seem significant, over time the card access reader can be a cost-effective option due to the reduced cost of operating and managing the premises. When compared to the time and resources associated with traditional security guards and manual locks, the cost savings add up quickly. 

Utilizing a door access card reader offers numerous benefits for property managers, landlords and building owners looking for solution to control access to their buildings. It offers an additional layer of security, convenient access control, flexible scheduling, efficient utilization management and a potentially significant reduction in cost over the long-term.
