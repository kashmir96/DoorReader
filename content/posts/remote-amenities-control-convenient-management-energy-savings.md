## Convenient Management & Energy Savings with Remote Amenities Control

Property Managers and Landlords are always looking for ways to better control access to their buildings, both for security and energy-saving purposes. Remote Amenities Control (RAC) provides a reliable and efficient solution for property owners seeking to manage access to their properties. It also provides great energy savings as well.

RAC systems enable property owners to effectively manage access to their buildings from any location. It allows for tracking of the occupancy of the premises, as well as monitoring and controlling certain amenities from a distance. For instance, landlords can remotely check tenant's access to the building, check for overdue privileges, or even schedule the energy consumption in their units to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. 

By using a RAC system, landlords can easily control the temperature and lighting of their buildings, ensuring that the air conditioning, heating and other amenities are not being overused while tenants are away, thereby conserving energy and money. Additionally, the automated scheduling of amenities and services, such as elevator usage, can reduce manpower and labor costs associated with monitoring and upkeep. Furthermore, property owners can set restrictions on access privileges and limit entry to certain areas of the building, making it easier to protect the safety of tenants.

In conclusion, Remote Amenities Control provides landlords, property managers and tenants a more convenient and efficient way of managing access to their properties as well as an energy-efficient way to reduce costs.
