## Unlock Possibilities with Collarless Bluetooth Dog Doors

As a property manager or landlord, you’re always looking for the latest in access control solutions for your building. That’s why you should consider Bluetooth dog doors, which can provide an innovative way to control access to your building. This solution is “collarless” – meaning it uses technology other than a dog’s existing identification tag to activate the door – giving you more control than ever before. 

Bluetooth dog doors use a “smart” transmitter attached to your pet’s collar. This transmitter is linked to the door itself and only allows it to open when your pet is within range. This can be helpful for a variety of reasons; not only does it give you some peace of mind that only your pet is entering the building, but it also means you can keep a record of the which animals are coming and going in your building. This is great for landlords who may charge pet fees to tenants with animals. 

In addition, Bluetooth dog doors are environmentally-friendly. The “green design” feature means these doors don’t leak energy or use unnecessary electricity, and some even have self-locking capabilities so they don’t unintentionally get left open.

Bluetooth dog doors are a cost-effective access control solution, allowing you to more efficiently protect and control the entry points of your building with no need for extra collar tracking devices. If you’re looking for a modern way to improve the way you manage access control, consider a collarless, Bluetooth dog door.
