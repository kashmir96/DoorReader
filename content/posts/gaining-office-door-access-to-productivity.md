## Office Space Managers Leverage ' Office Door Access' to Increase Productivity 

If you're a property manager or landlord looking to control access to your buildings while simultaneously improving tenant productivity, office door access offers a powerful solution. Office door access used in conjunction with proper office space management can help make your tenants more productive while providing peace of mind that your building is secure. 

Office door access can be used to grant or restrict access to different areas of your building, allowing you to manage access to specific tenants and visitors with the click of a button. Where previously you would need to physically unlock a door or scramble with keys, office door access allows you to customize your building's security system in real-time. By setting curfews or granting access based on certain criteria, tenants and visitors will be able to access the building swiftly and securely, reducing the need for multiple physical keys that can easily be misplaced or lost in the process. 

Alongside the physical security aspects of office door access, property managers and landlords can also use it to monitor the productivity of tenants. By tracking the number of people and amount of time spent in each area of the building, you can quickly spot any inefficiencies or irregularities and adjust to optimize the productivity of your building. This can be done in real-time and the data collected can be used to make informed decisions about how best to use the space in the future. 

In summary, office door access can significantly boost the productivity of tenants, while keeping a secure environment in the building. By utilizing office space management to properly monitor who is entering and leaving the building, and utilizing office door access to customize access to certain areas, you can make sure your property is both secure and productive.
