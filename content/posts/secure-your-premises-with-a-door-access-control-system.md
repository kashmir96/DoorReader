## Control Access to Your Building With a Door Access Control System

As a property manager or landlord, your primary concern is the safety and security of residents, employees, and visitors. To ensure your premises are secure, you need to look at implementing a door access control system. An access control system can provide peace of mind that a building can be accessed only by those with the necessary credentials. 

Doors can be locked or unlocked from a central operating station, connected to a computer. This can be customised with access levels by user and door. There are a range of access control systems available to suit your budget in different sizes and for different levels of security. 

The most basic access control system is a keylock system which can be used to open internal doors. Keypads, cards, and readers can be set up to provide electronic access control to the building. Smartphone access or cloud-based systems can be used for external doors with the added benefit of the ability to revoke or provide access at any time. 

Higher security systems, such as facial recognition, are available to ensure only authorised personnel can unlock the doors. For external doors, CCTV cameras and alarms can be implemented and connected to the access control system to provide another layer of security and activity tracking. 

The implementation of a door access control system can provide an effective security system to protect a building from misuse and unwanted access. Different systems can be tailored to meet the security measures a property requires.
