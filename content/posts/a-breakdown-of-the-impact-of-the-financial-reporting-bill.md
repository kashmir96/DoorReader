## Examining the Effects of Recent Financial Reporting Legislation 
When it comes to property management and landlord strategies, the ability to take control over access to a building is critical. However, in recent times, government lawmakers have implemented new financial reporting laws that can have an impact on the way properties are managed. With this in mind, landlords must keep themselves informed and consider the consequences of such changes. 

The primary objective of the Financial Reporting Bill (FRB) is to ensure property owners reach accurate declarations of income and expenditure relating to the management of their sites. Under the legislation, buildings are categorised as either Commercial or Residential, with different requirements for each type. The most significant impact is arguably on Residential properties, where landlords must provide comprehensive loan statements to reflect advances and capital expenses. They must also explain the terms and conditions of tenant issuance, as well as the rental accounts and balance of payments of tenants from March 2020 onwards. 

At the same time, commercial property owners are also subject to changes with the FRB. They must now provide detailed information on their financial position, as well as present records of rental income and expenditure. Such data must be submitted to the appropriate clause, and landlords may need to adjust their business systems for the purpose, as records must be maintained for at least 3 months. 

The implementation of the Financial Reporting Bill poses various responsibilities for those in the property market. To be compliant with the legislation, landlords must remain up to date with the changes, prepare properties and documents accordingly and adjust financial reporting processes in order to be in line with government requirements.
