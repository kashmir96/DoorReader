## All You Need to Know About Access Control Systems in NZ

Protect your properties, tenants and staff with secure access control systems in New Zealand. As property managers and landlords, you need to ensure that you can provide effective security for your properties without compromising tenant safety. Access control systems provide a robust and reliable way to control access to your buildings for both authorised personnel and visitors.

Access control systems typically include an interconnected series of access points and control systems which control and monitor entry into the buildings. These systems are built with the latest security technology and provide a multi-layer approach to security. Access control systems allow authorised individuals to enter the building while denying access to unauthorised people, and can be tailored to fit the specific security needs of your buildings.

Access control systems are not simply restricted to buildings, and can be used to monitor and restrict access to other areas such as carparks, grounds and staff-only areas. Access control systems allow you to only provide access to specific people at certain times and can be set up with a variety of options, such as time-limited access and the option to revoke access if needed. The systems can also be configured to alert you of any suspicious activity or attempted access by unauthorised personnel.

In addition to the increased safety and security for your property, staff and tenants, access control systems also provide an efficient and cost-effective solution to managing visitors. By having visitors log in and out through the access control systems, you can effectively keep track of who is entering and leaving your building, and ensure that all visitors are kept in line with your individual visitor policy.
