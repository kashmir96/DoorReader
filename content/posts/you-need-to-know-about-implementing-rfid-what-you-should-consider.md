## Implementing RFID: What Property Managers Need to Consider
Property managers and landlords looking for solutions to control access to their buildings should consider the installation of an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) security system. Implementing RFID technology provides a secure, contactless system that is quick and easy to use and is more reliable than other traditional access control systems. 

When considering RFID for your building’s access control needs, there are several aspects to consider. First, decide if you need only a basic access card reader setup or if you want a full system with multiple door readers and the ability to track usage. Once you’ve determined the system you need, you’ll need to decide what type of tags you’ll use. These can range from simple key cards to more sophisticated biometric scans. 

Choose an appropriate reader protocol to meet the needs of your business. Most higher grade readers can be programmed for different protocols, and some readers are designed to read multiple protocols.Think about the type of data you want to be able to access from your secure system. Do you want to track who is entering and leaving the premises, or would you like to log the time and date of each access event? When determining data access, it is important to consider what information you will and won’t share with certain people.

Finally, it’s essential to make sure your data is safe. Choose the most secure access control systems and be sure to invest in regular system backups, so your data is never compromised. 

Implementing an RFID system can be a great way to control access to your building with ease. Taking the time to consider all the aspects of RFID installation and use will ensure that you are making the right decision for your business and your building’s visitors.
