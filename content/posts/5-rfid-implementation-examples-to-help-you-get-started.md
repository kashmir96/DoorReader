## RFID Implementation to Control Building Access
Are you a property manager or landlord looking for solutions to control access to your building? RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology is an increasingly popular building access control system for employers and landlords alike. Read on for five RFID implementations to help you get started.

##### Basic Office Access Control 
Implementing a basic RFID access control system, such as card reader entry, is a simple way to restrict access to offices and other areas of the building for employees. Utilizing contactless, tokenized IDs in either a sticker or card form can be quickly and affordably installed in the entry and exit doors. 

##### Garages and Parking Lots
By leveraging an RFID system with automated entry gates, landlords can easily establish a contactless payment system for secure access to garages and parking lots while also controlling who can enter when. 

##### Security
By exposing an RFID access system to cameras, facial recognition and other security measures, landlords can help prevent unauthorized access while also reducing the need to monitor building visitors 24/7. 

##### Tamperproof
Installing tamper-proof RFID systems with hidden readers and other security features can help restrict entry to certain areas of the building for authorized personnel and help landlords take major control of the building access control measures. 

##### Home and Business Automation
Adding RFID to home and business automation systems is another way landlords can control who can access certain areas of the building. By syncing alarm systems, surveillance and other automated features with the access control system, landlords can ensure their building is secure while also making sure only authorized personnel has access.

In conclusion, RFID technology provides a variety of solutions for controlling building access. Easy and affordable to implement, RFID access can provide property managers and landlords with the flexibility to control access to the building and help prevent unauthorized entry.
