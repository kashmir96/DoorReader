## Comfort and Security for Cats with FID Cat Doors 

As a property manager or landlord looking for ways to control access to your buildings, you may have considered a FID cat door. This can be a great way to give your feline tenants more control and freedom. Not only that, but it also offers an added layer of security for your property. 

A FID (Feline Information Database) cat door uses a chip embedded in the pet to activate the entry system. This chip works with an access point in the house, allowing cats to come and go as they please without needing to be let in and out by a person. This helps to keep the security of your property in check, as only cats with an implanted chip will be able to enter. 

This type of access control also provides a unique benefit to the cats themselves. It allows them to have the freedom to move around in the house and the outside environment without the need of someone else continuously opening and closing doors or letting them out all of the time. This type of control gives them the ability to roam around while also still offering protection from predators or other risks and dangers. 

As a property manager or landlord, you can gain the benefits of a FID cat door without having to worry about any downtime or damage to the property as you can easily control access with the chip and access point. This provides more freedom for cats living in rental units and gives landlords the security of knowing that only their cats will be able to gain entrance. 

Overall, a FID cat door offers both comfort and security to your furry tenants. This type of access control gives cats the freedom to roam while adding extra protection and security to the property.
