## Choosing a Door Access Control System for Your Property Management Needs

As a property manager or landlord, you are likely tasked with finding the right door access control system to safely manage and control access to your building. With so many options available, this is a daunting task. But determining the right vendor for your needs doesn’t have to be intimidating. There are important considerations you should make to ensure you select a provider who can deliver a reliable and future-proof solution. 

One of the most important factors to consider is the company's reputation. Research their reviews and customer feedback to ensure their solution has been proven to work in the long run. Ask questions about any additional features they offer, such as presence detection, remote control, and real-time monitoring of access and egress points. You'll also want to discuss SLA and post-sales support services. 

Another thing to consider is the compatibility of their installed software and hardware with existing systems. An integrated solution enables easier maintenance, streamlined services, and convenient support. Investing in a scalable solution is important if you anticipate your needs will change over time.

It's worth asking if the company provides technical training and support for employees. Understanding how the access control system works is imperative for seamless operations. Lastly, you should check to see if the vendor offers any financing options or other special deals. 

Ultimately, finding the right door access control system for your property management needs involves researching, weighing the options, and asking the right questions.
