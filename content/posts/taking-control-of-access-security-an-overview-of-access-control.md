## Gaining Command Over Your Property with Access Control

Property managers and landlords strive to maintain the safety and security of their property. One way of doing this is by controlling who is allowed access to their buildings. This is where access control comes in.

Access control is a security measure that is used to regulate who has access to a certain area and/or resources. Access control can be as simple as a key lock on a door, or as complex as an electronic card-reader system that checks credentials before allowing entry. The type of access control system needed is determined by what level of security is desired, as well as the size and needs of the building.

The most important aspect of an access control system is maintaining an audit trail of who has accessed the property. This will allow the property manager or landlord to monitor who is moving around the premises, as well as identify potential issues. Access control systems can also be set to restrict access during certain times of day and/or for certain days of the week. This can help keep the property more secure when certain areas are closed or if certain resources need to be locked away.

Basic access control such as keypad locks and keycard systems are popular and affordable options for landlords and property managers. They can be installed relatively easily, and do not require a complex system setup. More advanced access control systems, such as biometric readers and facial recognition, are also available - but they come with a greater installation cost.

No matter what kind of access control system is selected, it is important to have a reliable service provider in order to upkeep the system and troubleshoot any malfunctioning parts. 

At the end of the day, access control is an incredibly beneficial security measure for landlords and property managers, but it is important to research what type of access control system is necessary for their particular situation. Taking the time to properly setup an access control system will not only improve the security of their property but also save a considerable amount of money in the long run.
